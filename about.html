  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>I'm a Caige, a web developer in Phoenix, Arizona. I am a self-proclaimed constructineer or sorts.</p>
  <p>I'm a father and husband, amateur marathon trainer and preparer of meals.</p>
  <h1>Programming</h1>
  <p>Rubist, Pythonista, Open Source Hacker ... I have many titles.</p>
  <p>I spend most of my time building web applications using all sorts of languages and frameworks. I'm currently focused on front-end technologies at the moment but find myself dipping my toes into things like <a href="http://julialang.org">Julia</a>, <a href="http://factorcode.org">Factor</a> and <a href="http://lua.org">Lua</a> from time to time.</p>
  <p>You can find some of my projects on <a href="http://github.com/caiges">GitHub</a> or you can <a href="mailto:me@caigenichols.com?subject=I have an idea that I think you can help me with">contact me</a> if you have an idea you'd like to see come to fruition.</p>
